The following are personal conventions for consistency and maintenance.

1.   An instance attribute always starts with an underbar. It is referenced, assigned, and removed only in functions defined in its class, viewed as a small namespace in which objects are internally shared.
2.   'if' statements follow the "false-first".
3.1  The preparation for training goes as follows: Tensor -> gpu -> graph
3.2  The preparation for evaluation goes as follows: detach -> cpu -> array
4.1  A shallow copy is always named '_'.
4.2  Comment "###" is added wherever a detaching operation is, in that it is a bit more complicated than mere shallow copy.
