"""
'inspect.currentframe' returns a live frame like 'globals', as opposed to 'locals' which returns a snapshot of the moment.
However, only the 'f_locals' property returns a copy of the dictionary that is updated on read but not write-through,
inconsistent with being a live object. This is fixed in Python3.13, 'inspect.currentframe' becoming fully live.
